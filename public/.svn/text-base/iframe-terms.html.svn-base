	<li>The competition is open to all UK residents aged 18 or over, except Orange employees, agents or their families or any company associated with this competition.</li> 
	<li>Entrants can only enter once per day.</li> 
	<li>At 3pm we'll determine the location of the Bull according to which grid he ends up in.  Our decision on this is final.  We'll display the result on screen, this could take up to 15 minutes.  Everyone who correctly guessed the square that the bull will be in at 3pm on the day of the draw will be entered into the prize draw. One person's name will be randomly chosen from the group. All the participants that have chosen the correct zone will be emailed to let them know.  All entry instructions form part of the terms and conditions.</li>
	<li>The number of winners will depend on whether the person who is picked from the draw is in a team.   All winning registered team players will win a pair of tickets each.    The maximum number of people in a team is 4.</li>
	<li>The bull's location will be determined by an independent observer.</li>  
	<li>Entries can be made online at www.spotthebull.co.uk up until 2pm everyday, between 27 May 2008 and 13 June 2008 inclusive. The winner/s will be drawn on these dates at 3pm and the winner/s will be notified by phone within 24 hours of the day of draw. Up until the 6th June you have one week to respond to that call in order to claim your tickets. After that (up until the 12th June), you'll need to respond within 24 hours, and on the final day (13th June) we'll need you to respond by 4pm. This is because we need to register your winning tickets with your details on two weeks before the actual festival.</li>
