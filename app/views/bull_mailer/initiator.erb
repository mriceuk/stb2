Hi <%= @name %>

You’ve chosen square <%= @playing_square_id.to_s %>.  And you’ve invited friends to play.

To join your team they need to use the invitation link we’ve sent them by 2pm (don't worry, if they don’t your square’s still safe).

Remember, the more friends who play, the better your chances of winning so it might be worth giving them a nudge.   

If Winston ends up in any of your team’s squares, you’ll all go into the draw.  And if any of you win, you’ll all get pairs of tickets.  Not bad, eh?

Good Luck.
